# Python datascience project with panda and numpy 

The objective of the project was to read and extract informations from a 300MB CSV file containing the cartesian positions (x,y,z) of all the players of a basketball game at each second and to track them.  
I had to make some statistical graphs like the total distance traveled for a single player or the total cumulated distance traveled for a team. The project was originally developed on jupyter then converted into a python source file.

# Usage 
`$ python data_science.py`
